## ✨ Fun Fact
Back in the day, my friends used to call me ‘Khaduss.’ It all started with a practical file submission. I hid my practical file in my bag, and when a classmate asked to borrow it, I refused. He noticed my bag's zipper was open and saw the file inside. From that day on, he started calling me 'Khaduss,' and the name stuck!
